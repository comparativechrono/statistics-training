/* Cross-origin isolation – what lets R wait for what is typed (readline(), browser(), q()'s question) and be
   interrupted with Esc (see isolation-sw.js). Where the server sends the headers itself (serve.py), the page is isolated
   from the start. Elsewhere (GitHub Pages) the service worker isolation-sw.js adds them: the first time the workbench is
   opened, the worker is installed and the page is loaded once more, at once – before anything has been done in it. It
   is not loaded again and again: if the page is still not isolated after that, it stays as it is (R then says what it
   cannot do). The service worker also serves the Shiny apps that R runs (shiny.js), isolated or not.

   window.WB_ISOLATION = { isolated, reason } – reason, when the page is not isolated: 'insecure' (not https, nor
   localhost), 'no-service-worker' (the browser has none here: a private window in some browsers), 'off' (opened with
   ?isolation=off: the service worker is removed), 'not-yet' (installed now: the page is about to load again),
   'no-effect' (installed, but the page is still not isolated), or the error of the registration.
   This file is the first script of the page. */
